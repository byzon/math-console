# math-console
Command line game for simple math practice. Built in Rust.

This was created in order help with basic grade school level arithmetic practice. Most of the games available were poorly made, required monthly subscriptions, or didn't have the simple feature set I needed.

The intention is to add to it over time. But for now, it's pretty simple.

Supported problems:
- Addition (2 digit)
- Subtraction (2 digit)
- Multiplication (2 digit)
- Division (2 digit)

Supported configuration:
- Highest number that can appear in a equation (lowest is 1)
- Number of questions.
